				<h3>Shatter</h3> <p>is a brittle, glass-like cannabis extract named for its breakability. It has a glassy appearance and tends to break, or shatter, like glass when snapped in two. Like other cannabis concentrates, shatter is a favorite among dabbing enthusiasts. Properly cured shatter comes from a careful and unrushed manufacturing process.</p>

				<h3>Dry flower</h3> <p>refers to Marijuana that has been cured and dried. The most popular way to trim the plant for drying is to cut off the top 12 to 16 inches of the plant â€“ including the actual flower, removing any unwanted leaves and hanging the branches that were cut off from a wire. After being picked, marijuana plants are dried and cured by hanging the plants upside down allowing all the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to flow down into the buds. Harvested marijuana must be placed in a dark room in a temperature range of 60 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit along with the humidity level in between 45% to 55% with a small fan to gently circulate the air. This method of drying helps prevent the cannabis plants from developing mold.</p>
